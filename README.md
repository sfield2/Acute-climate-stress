# Acute-climate-stress

This directory contains code written in R for all analyses, and a directory for all data used, in:

 S. Field and D. Glowacki. 2023. Climate and Community in Central Mesa Verde. Submitted to Journal of Quaternary Science (May, 2023).
 
## Data 

Portions of the data used in this research is provided in folder entitled "DATA". Sensitive site and ceramic data is not included. As a result complete demographic reconstructions cannot be fully replicated; however, the data needed to:

1) replicate climate reconstructions at Far View 
2) replicate occupation curves for structures at Yellow Jacket Pueblo

are avaialbe in the "DATA" folder. 

Additionally the summarized demographic and acute stress data for Far View, Morefield Canyong Great House Village, and Yellow Jacket Pueblo, which are needed to conduct the Match Interval analyses are also available in the "DATA" folder.  

Contact Sean for requests of sensitive data (e.g., calibration ceramics.csv).

## Analysis

Script used for analysis is an R script, entitled "ANALYSIS.R", that contains all code to replicate many of the steps presented in the publication.
